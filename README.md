For this assignment I was tasked with changing the existing code of a website to make it more accessible for individuals with physical/situational disabilities or those with socio-economic restrictions on internet bandwith and connection speeds. Not everyone is able to access the internet similarly, some individuals need screen readers, text to speech software, text to braille hardware, etc. Using "Semantic HTML" is an ethical approach to allowing everyone the same opportunity to use your website, and allows these configurations to equally access the information. Semantic HTML addresses the needs of those with learning difficulties, motor and mobility difficulties, or who are visually impaired, hearing impaired, cognitively impaired, seizure prone, dyslexic, and so much more. Aside from the morality of the topic, many lawsuits have come from unequal access to the web, so this has become increasingly more important to companies over the years. I was also asked to consolidate and clean up the appearance and structure of the code while converting it to Semantic HTML. I added comments within the code so that it can be quickly understood by someone who may need to access it for updates in the future.

Changes made in the HTML file:

  - Replaced < div > tags with more semantic elements like..  
    * < nav >
    * < main >
    * < aside >
    * < footer >
    * < figure >
    * < header >
    * < article >
    
- Included alt attributes within all images.
- Made sure that the code was in a logical structure.
- Added comments for ease of viewing and re-visiting later.
- Made sure that all links were working, adjusting a broken item.
- Gave the website's title element a concise and descriptive title.
- Adjusted the order of heading tags so that they were in sequental order.
